## Template Usage Notes

**This is a TEMPLATE. Replace all bracketed placeholders with actual content.**

**When to Use This Template**:
- Getting started guides ("Get started with [Technology]")
- Onboarding tutorials ("Build your first [Project Type]")
- Learning tutorials ("Learn [Concept] by building [Project]")
- Quick start guides ("Create a [Project] in [Time]")

**Structure Guidelines**:

1. **Start with Quick Win**: Part 1 should achieve something visible/working quickly
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Each part builds on previous, gradually adding complexity
3. **Frequent Success Checks**: Every step should have clear success criteria
4. **Realistic Time Estimates**: Test the tutorial, then add 50% for beginners
5. **Minimal Explanation**: Focus on WHAT to do, not WHY (save WHY for Explanation docs)

**Part Structure**:
- **Part 1**: Quick win (something working)
- **Part 2**: Build on Part 1 (add features)
- **Part 3**: Complete the project (polish + final features)
- **More parts**: OK if needed, but keep under 5 total parts

**Step Structure**:
Each step should follow this pattern:
1. Clear instruction (what to do)
2. Complete code example (tested)
3. Explanation of code (simple terms)
4. Test/verification (run it)
5. Success criteria (how to know it worked)
6. Common errors (if applicable)

**Remember**:
1. ✅ Test ENTIRE tutorial start-to-finish before publishing
2. ✅ Test with someone who matches target audience (if possible)
3. ✅ Every step must have success criteria
4. ✅ Time estimates must be realistic
5. ✅ Use beginner-friendly language
6. ✅ Verify all APIs against source
7. ❌ NO assumptions about prior knowledge (beyond prerequisites)
8. ❌ NO skipped steps (every step explicit)
9. ❌ NO untested code examples
10. ❌ NO "this is easy" or "simply" (unless it actually is)

**Diátaxis Type**: Tutorial (Learning-oriented)
**Focus**: Learning by doing (step-by-step from zero to working result)
**Audience**: Beginners (explicitly state experience level)
**Do NOT include**: Problem-solving patterns (use How-To guides), complete API reference (link to Reference docs), deep WHY explanations (link to Explanation docs)
